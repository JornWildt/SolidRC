# SolidRC
A journey into building Solid applications with C#, Dotnet Core, RDFLIB.js, Vue.js and other JavaScript libraries (vuelidator, moment).

Trying to create a re-useable pattern for doing data-entry, validation and querying on data stored in Solid PODs.

Example case is a logbook for logging flights with remote controlled aircraft models.
