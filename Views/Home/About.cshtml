<h1>@ViewData["Title"]</h1>

<p>Solid-RC is a personal project by Jørn Wildt, Allerød, Denmark. The purpose is first and foremost
    to explore the possibilities of the <a href="https://solid.inrupt.com/">Solid</a> framework.
    The result so far is nice little tracker of activites with radio controlled toys - feel free to
    play around with it.</p>

<p>Any content you create will be stored in your own Solid POD. This means the content will still exist long after
   the Solid-RC application is gone. Your content belongs to you - not Solid-RC.</p>

<p>This also means you need to create a Solid POD before starting Solid-RC. Se <a href="https://solid.inrupt.com/how-it-works">Solid Explained</a>
for more information about Solid.</p>
